## Project Type

### Option 2 - Online Data Analysis

#### Data Sources
- *970+ football leagues & cups. Live score (updated every 15s), live & pre-match odds, events, line-ups, coaches, players, top scorers, standings, statistics, transfers, predictions*
    - *https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3*

#### Analysis Plan
- *The performance of a team changes with respect to where they are playing(home/away). Compare the goals of two different teams in their respective home stadiums.*
- *Player performance for a club vs his country. Number goals scored by a player is taken as a metric for player performance*
- *Number of matches won by the team in which the top scorer/ top assist is present. Get the data of top 10 score/assist player and compare them with standings of the team in that league*
- *Performance of player before and after transfer*
- *Age vs goals scored for a specific player/league*
##### Justification
   *The chosen data contains all the parameters (teams, players, leagues, fixtures, game statistics, past records, player transfer details) that are considered for this analysis*

#### Motivation
- *Considering that Soccer is followed by millions of people across the globe, huge money is involved and is constantly evolving, with new technologies, tactics, and strategies emerging all the time, it seemed appropriate to provide analytics for soccer*
